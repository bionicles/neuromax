# STATUS:

WIP/ALPHA.

Not where I want it yet, and may contain, ahem, "harsh language"

I set out to replace GROMACS with NEUROMAX.
All I got was this shitty AI inspired by the Biobricks standard.

Currently focused on a JS meta-framework so my attention is limited, but
I intend to convert my dev process for this repo to a document-driven style

# TLDR: biologically inspired AI 

- nature: contains the agent which assembles a graph of bricks
- nurture: contains tasks/data from which to learn

# CONTRIBUTORS:

definitely happy to work with you on new tasks, bricks, or tools

call/text Bion Howard 843.830.2918 between 1-5pm EST for any issues

I check email (bion@bitpharma.com) rarely to focus on code
