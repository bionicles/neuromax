brick injector
deformable conv
capsules
reservoirs
differentiable neural dictionary
add, subtract, multiply, divide
PRELU/RRELU
mixed convolutions
tfp layers
tfp distributions
tfp bijectors ?
replay buffer (duh)
tied-weight autoencoder?
pooling (ugh)
noise?
optimization problems https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00443.pdf
neural ode
infinite set convolutions (recursion or np.indices)
subpixel conv
look at multiply layers ... like attention
maxout
RNNs could go back in
could make the graphmodel a rnn cell to handle recurrent state ...
